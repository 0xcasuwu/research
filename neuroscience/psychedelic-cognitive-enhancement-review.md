# Psychedelics and Tianeptine as Cognitive Enhancers: A Comprehensive Evidence Review

## Executive Summary

This review synthesizes the clinical and preclinical evidence through early 2026 for four substances with emerging — and often contested — nootropic potential: **lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD)**, **psilocybin**, **N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT)/ayahuasca**, and **tianeptine**. These compounds span two mechanistic families: the classical serotonergic psychedelics (LSD, psilocybin, DMT) acting primarily through 5-HT2A receptor agonism, and tianeptine, a mu-opioid receptor agonist with glutamatergic and neuroplastic properties historically misclassified as an SSRI.

The overall picture is one of **mechanistic promise tempered by methodological limitations**. For microdosing psychedelics, the most rigorous evidence (meta-analysis of 14 controlled studies, N=1,614) finds no cognitive enhancement and a possible decrease in cognitive control (d = -0.34). For full-dose psychedelics, selective post-acute improvements in cognitive flexibility, divergent thinking, and memory have been observed, with robust neuroimaging evidence of enhanced neural plasticity and brain network reorganization persisting weeks after administration. For tianeptine, animal models demonstrate striking hippocampal neurogenesis and stress-reversal effects, but human cognitive enhancement data remain sparse, and the substance carries significant addiction liability.

Across all four substances, the strongest mechanistic signal is **neuroplasticity** — BDNF upregulation, TrkB-mTOR signaling, dendritic spine growth, and hippocampal neurogenesis — raising the question of whether short-term cognitive enhancement or long-term neuroprotection is the more relevant clinical endpoint.

## 1. LSD (Lysergic Acid Diethylamide)

### 1.1 Pharmacology

LSD is a potent partial agonist at serotonin 5-HT2A receptors (Ki ~1-3 nM), with additional activity at 5-HT1A, 5-HT2B, 5-HT2C, dopamine D1/D2, and adrenergic receptors. Its subjective and neural effects are fully blocked by the 5-HT2A antagonist ketanserin, confirming this receptor as the primary mediator of its psychoactive effects. LSD's unusually long duration of action (8-12 hours) is attributed to a "lid" formed by extracellular loop 2 over the binding pocket, trapping the molecule in the receptor ([Wacker et al., 2017; *Cell*](https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(16)31749-4)).

### 1.2 Microdosing: The Null Hypothesis Holds

Microdosing — typically 5-20 ug every 3-4 days — has generated enormous public interest as a purported cognitive enhancer. The controlled evidence, however, is remarkably consistent in its null findings.

**Key RCTs:**

| Study | N | Design | Dose | Duration | Cognitive Outcome |
|-------|---|--------|------|----------|-------------------|
| Bershad et al. (2019) | 20 | Double-blind, within-subjects | 6.5, 13, 26 ug | Acute | No effects on RAT, N-back, or DSST |
| Hutten et al. (2020) | 24 | Placebo-controlled, within-subjects | 5, 10, 20 ug | Acute | Reduced attentional lapses at 5 & 20 ug; decreased set-shifting at 20 ug ([PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33082016/)) |
| Murphy et al. (2023) | 80 | Double-blind, parallel-group | 10 ug q3d | 6 weeks | Acute mood elevation on dose days; NO enduring cognitive or mood change ([*Biological Psychiatry*](https://www.biologicalpsychiatryjournal.com/article/S0006-3223(23)01164-2/fulltext)) |
| Murphy et al. (2024) | 80 | Same trial, creativity sub-study | 10 ug q3d | 6 weeks | No effect on AUT, RAT, CAT, or EPSQ despite self-reported "feeling more creative" ([*Psychopharmacology*](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00213-024-06680-z)) |
| Mueller et al. (2025) | 53 | Phase 2A RCT, double-blind | 20 ug 2x/week | 6 weeks | No between-group difference in ADHD symptoms vs. placebo ([*JAMA Psychiatry*](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/2831639)) |

**The definitive meta-analysis** (Pinhas et al., 2026): 14 studies, N=1,614, 59 effect sizes. Overall Cohen's d = **-0.06** (95% CI [-0.24, 0.12], p = 0.48) — effectively null. Cognitive control showed a significant *decrease* (d = -0.34). Neither substance type, dosage, nor duration moderated results ([*Neuroscience & Biobehavioral Reviews*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0149763425004944)).

**The citizen-science perspective** (Szigeti et al., 2021; N=191): The largest placebo-controlled psychedelic trial found that all outcomes improved equally in microdose and placebo groups. Participants' *beliefs* about condition assignment predicted outcomes more strongly than actual assignment ([*eLife*](https://elifesciences.org/articles/62878)).

**Summary:** LSD microdosing does not enhance cognition in controlled settings. Self-reported benefits are consistent with expectancy/placebo effects. The one consistent acute finding — reduced attentional lapses — comes with a trade-off of impaired cognitive flexibility.

### 1.3 Full-Dose LSD: Selective Cognitive Effects

In contrast to the null microdosing literature, full-dose studies (50-200 ug) report selective post-acute cognitive changes:

- **Visuospatial memory enhancement:** Wiessner et al. (2022; N=24, double-blind crossover, 50 ug) found improved Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure recall and 2D Object-Location Memory at 24 hours post-dose, accompanied by improved phonological verbal fluency — but impaired Wisconsin Card Sorting Test performance. This "afterglow with hangover" pattern suggests LSD enhances consolidation-dependent memory while transiently reducing cognitive flexibility ([*European Neuropsychopharmacology*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0924977X22001249)).

- **Nootropic-like memory effects with mTOR involvement:** Ornelas et al. (2022; N=25 crossover, 50 ug) demonstrated enhanced visuospatial memory in humans alongside enhanced novel object recognition in rats, with proteomic analysis implicating the mTOR signaling pathway ([*Experimental Neurology*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S001448862200173X)).

- **Enhanced reinforcement learning:** Kanen et al. (2023; N=19 crossover, 75 ug IV) found increased learning rate, decreased stimulus stickiness, and increased exploratory behavior — suggesting LSD promotes cognitive flexibility in reward-based learning ([*Psychological Medicine*; PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10600934/)).

### 1.4 Mechanisms Relevant to Cognition

**5-HT2A agonism** drives cortical glutamate release via layer V pyramidal neuron excitation, increasing cortical excitability and network entropy. The REBUS (Relaxed Beliefs Under Psychedelics) model proposes that psychedelics flatten hierarchical predictive coding, enabling more flexible cognition and belief revision ([Carhart-Harris & Friston, 2019](https://www.pharmrev.org/content/71/3/316)).

**Neuroplasticity:** LSD promotes dendritogenesis, spinogenesis, and synaptogenesis through multiple convergent pathways:
- mTOR signaling (Ornelas et al., 2022)
- BDNF/TrkB pathway — psychedelics may directly bind TrkB receptors, promoting plasticity independently of 5-HT2A ([Moliner et al., 2023](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-023-01316-5))
- Presynaptic 5-HT2A on thalamic inputs enabling synaptic enhancement in neurons lacking postsynaptic 5-HT2A (2025 finding; [*Nature — Molecular Psychiatry*](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-025-03257-w))

**Default Mode Network disruption:** LSD decreases intra-DMN connectivity while increasing between-network connectivity, producing a less hierarchical, more entropic brain state that correlates with ego dissolution and, potentially, cognitive flexibility ([PMC — DMN systematic review](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10032309/)).

### 1.5 Therapeutic Pipeline

MindMed's MM-120 completed a Phase 2b trial for generalized anxiety disorder (N=198; 100 ug: -7.6 points vs. placebo on HAM-A, Cohen's d = 0.81; 65% response, 48% remission at week 12; [*JAMA*](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2838505)). While not a cognitive enhancement trial, sustained anxiety reduction may produce secondary cognitive benefits through reduced rumination and improved executive function.

---

## 2. Psilocybin

### 2.1 Pharmacology

Psilocybin is a prodrug rapidly dephosphorylated to psilocin, a potent 5-HT2A agonist (Ki ~6 nM). It also acts at 5-HT2C, 5-HT1A, and other serotonin receptor subtypes. Unlike LSD, psilocin's duration of action is 4-6 hours owing to normal receptor kinetics without the "lid" mechanism.

### 2.2 Microdosing: Marginal at Best

The controlled literature mirrors LSD's null findings:

- **Cavanna et al. (2022; N=34, double-blind):** No evidence of enhanced well-being, creativity, or cognitive function beyond placebo. EEG changes present but without behavioral correlates ([*Translational Psychiatry*](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41398-022-02039-0)).

- **2025 Neuropharmacology study (two RCTs, semi-naturalistic):** Microdosing did not significantly affect behavioral or subjective measures after multiple comparison correction.

- **2025 Creativity mega-analysis (3 RCTs, N=171):** Microdosing psilocybin increased *quality* of original ideas (divergent thinking) but showed no improvement in convergent thinking. Effect was subtle and partially attributable to expectancy.

- **Rootman et al. (2022; N=953 observational):** Small-to-medium improvements in mood and — notably — psychomotor performance in adults over 55, particularly when "stacking" psilocybin with lion's mane and niacin. However, this was an unblinded naturalistic study with severe confounding ([*Scientific Reports*](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-14512-3)).

**Takeaway:** As with LSD, psilocybin microdosing lacks robust evidence for cognitive enhancement. A subtle divergent-thinking signal exists but is small and inconsistent.

### 2.3 Full-Dose Psilocybin: Cognitive Flexibility and Neural Reorganization

The full-dose literature (15-30 mg) is more encouraging:

**Cognitive flexibility:**
- Doss et al. (2021; Johns Hopkins; N=24, open-label, MDD patients): Increased cognitive flexibility persisting at least 4 weeks, plus increased PCC-ACC dynamic functional connectivity. Cognitive improvements were independent of antidepressant response ([*Translational Psychiatry*](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41398-021-01706-y)).

**Creativity:**
- Mason et al. (2021; N=60, double-blind): Psilocybin acutely *impaired* deliberate creativity (convergent d=0.85; divergent fluency d=0.84) but increased subjective creative insights. At 7 days, number of novel ideas increased (d=0.52) while convergent thinking remained impaired (d=0.60) ([*Translational Psychiatry*](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41398-021-01335-5)).

**Brain network reorganization:**
- Daws et al. (2022; Imperial College; N=59, fMRI across two trials): Psilocybin increased global brain network integration in 5-HT2A-rich higher-order networks. Escitalopram showed no comparable changes ([*Nature Medicine*](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-022-01744-z)).

- **Siegel et al. (2024; precision functional mapping, *Nature*):** Psilocybin caused >3-fold greater disruption of functional connectivity than methylphenidate, with hippocampus-DMN connectivity changes persisting up to 3 weeks ([*Nature*](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07624-5)).

**Acute executive function impairment:**
- Yousefi et al. (2025; meta-analysis, 13 studies, 42 effect sizes): Psilocybin dose-dependently increases reaction time (g=1.13) during acute intoxication with accuracy largely preserved (g=-0.45). Executive functions are acutely impaired but recover fully ([*Psychopharmacology*](https://link.springer.com/journal/213)).

### 2.4 Mechanisms

Psilocybin shares LSD's core mechanisms (5-HT2A agonism, DMN disruption, REBUS model) with several distinctive features:

**Direct TrkB binding:** Psilocin binds TrkB receptors with nanomolar affinity (Ki = 6.73 nM), potentially promoting neuroplasticity independently of 5-HT2A activation ([Castre'n group; *Trends in Pharmacological Sciences*, 2025](https://www.cell.com/trends/pharmacological-sciences/fulltext/S0165-6147(25)00200-7)).

**BDNF-TrkB-mTOR cascade:** 5-HT2A-mediated glutamate release stimulates AMPA receptors, triggering BDNF secretion. BDNF-TrkB signaling activates mTOR, PI3K/AKT, and ERK1/2-CREB pathways, promoting dendritic spine growth and synaptogenesis in prefrontal cortex and hippocampus ([*Neuropsychopharmacology*, 2022](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41386-022-01389-z)).

**Neuroplastic window:** Synaptogenesis begins within hours, peaks at 1-3 days, and new dendritic spines can persist for at least 1 month (mouse data). The window is likely experience-dependent — psychological content during this period may shape long-term outcomes.

### 2.5 Clinical Pipeline

**COMPASS Pathways COMP360** achieved primary endpoints in both Phase 3 trials (Feb 2026):
- COMP005 (N=258): -3.6 MADRS points vs. placebo at week 6 (p<.001)
- COMP006 (two 25 mg doses): -3.8 MADRS points (p<.001)
- NDA filing anticipated Q4 2026; potential launch early 2027

**Usona PSIL201** (Raison et al., 2023; N=104, *JAMA*): -12.3 MADRS difference vs. niacin placebo (p<.001) with rapid onset by day 8.

## 3. DMT and Ayahuasca

### 3.1 Pharmacology

DMT is a potent 5-HT2A agonist (Ki ~75 nM) with a uniquely short duration of action when administered intravenously (15-30 minutes) due to rapid monoamine oxidase (MAO) metabolism. In ayahuasca — the traditional Amazonian brew combining DMT-containing plants (*Psychotria viridis*) with MAO-inhibiting beta-carboline alkaloids (*Banisteriopsis caapi*: harmine, harmaline, tetrahydroharmine) — duration extends to 4-6 hours through oral bioavailability enabled by MAO inhibition.

Beyond 5-HT2A, DMT activates the **sigma-1 receptor (S1R)** — an intracellular chaperone at the ER-mitochondria interface that regulates calcium signaling, neuroprotection, and cell survival. This dual mechanism distinguishes DMT from LSD and psilocybin.

### 3.2 Cognitive Effects of Ayahuasca

**Acute effects:** Ayahuasca impairs working memory but decreases stimulus-response interference (a marker of cognitive control). Executive function deficits are observed primarily in less experienced users, suggesting neuroadaptation with repeated use (Bouso et al., 2013; [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23793226/)).

**Post-acute "afterglow" (24-72 hours):** Enhanced mindfulness capacities, creative divergent thinking, psychological flexibility, and cognitive reappraisal. Murphy-Beiner & Soar (2020) found enhanced convergent and divergent thinking subacutely.

**Episodic memory enhancement:** Riba et al. (2025; N=24 experienced Santo Daime members) demonstrated that pre-encoding ayahuasca administration enhanced hit rates, memory accuracy, and recollection without increasing false memory susceptibility. Effects were large and selective ([PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11967096/)).

**Long-term regular users show no impairment and possible enhancement:**
- Bouso et al. (2012; N=127 users + 115 controls, longitudinal): Regular ayahuasca users showed better performance on Stroop, Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, and Letter-Number Sequencing. No evidence of cognitive impairment or psychological maladjustment ([PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22905130/)).
- Bouso et al. (2015; N=22+22, MRI): Significant cortical thickness differences in midline structures including the posterior cingulate cortex.

### 3.3 Synthetic DMT Clinical Studies

**IV DMT extended infusion** (Luan, Timmermann et al., 2024; N=32, within-subjects, placebo-controlled): Extended IV DMT infusions (bolus + 30-min constant-rate) demonstrated psychological and physiological safety with positive subjective insights lasting beyond the trial ([*Journal of Psychopharmacology*](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/02698811231196877)).

**Neuroimaging** (Timmermann et al., 2023; N=20, placebo-controlled EEG-fMRI): IV DMT produced global hyperconnectivity, collapsed hierarchical brain organization, reduced alpha power, increased delta power, and heightened Lempel-Ziv complexity (enhanced neural signal diversity). Regions with densest 5-HT2A expression were most affected ([*PNAS*](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2218949120)).

**SPL026 Phase IIa for MDD** (Helus Pharma, 2025; N=34, double-blind RCT): Single 21.5 mg IV DMT produced -10.75 MADRS points at week 1 (p=0.002) and -7.35 at week 2 (p=0.023). Response rate 35% vs. 12% placebo. Open-label extension suggested effects persisting 3-6 months ([*Nature Medicine*](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-04154-z)).

**Vaporized DMT Phase 2a for TRD** (Falchi-Carvalho, Palhano-Fontes et al., 2025; N=14, open-label): -21.14 MADRS reduction at day 7 (p<0.001); 85.71% response rate; 57.14% remission rate. Effects lasted up to 3 months. However, this was uncontrolled with N=14 ([PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40258990/)).

### 3.4 Sigma-1 Receptor and Neurogenesis

The sigma-1 receptor mechanism represents DMT's most distinctive nootropic signal:

- **Morales-Garcia et al. (2020):** DMT activated hippocampal subgranular zone neurogenesis in mice via S1R, promoting neural stem cell proliferation, neuroblast migration, and new neuron generation. S1R antagonist BD1063 blocked these effects. DMT-treated mice showed **improved spatial learning and memory** on Morris water maze and novel object recognition tasks ([*Translational Psychiatry*](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41398-020-01011-0)).

- **Important caveat:** A 2022 follow-up using an Alzheimer's model (Abeta1-42 oligomers) found DMT did NOT promote neurogenesis in that context, possibly due to competing 5-HT2A/S1R binding dynamics. A selective S1R agonist (PRE084) was more effective ([*IJMS*](https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/23/5/2514)).

### 3.5 BDNF Modulation

**de Almeida et al. (2019):** First RCT to measure BDNF modulation by ayahuasca. A single dose increased serum BDNF in both healthy volunteers and patients with treatment-resistant depression, from the Palhano-Fontes RCT sample ([*Frontiers in Psychology*](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2019.01234/full)).

Downstream signaling proceeds through the BDNF → TrkB → PI3K-Akt-mTOR and MAPK/ERK cascades, driving protein synthesis for structural synaptic plasticity. AMPA receptor activation creates a positive feedback loop: enhanced AMPA activity → increased BDNF secretion → TrkB/mTOR activation → sustained dendritic growth outlasting acute drug effects.

## 4. Tianeptine

### 4.1 Pharmacology: Not an SSRI

Tianeptine has been persistently misclassified as a "selective serotonin reuptake enhancer" (SSRE) — a designation based on early, now-discredited pharmacological models. Current understanding identifies tianeptine as:

- **Full mu-opioid receptor (MOR) agonist** (EC50 ~194 nM) — the primary mechanism of its antidepressant and anxiolytic effects ([Gassaway et al., 2014; *Translational Psychiatry*](https://www.nature.com/articles/tp201430))
- **Delta-opioid receptor (DOR) agonist** (weaker affinity)
- **Glutamatergic modulator** — normalizes stress-induced alterations in glutamate transmission, particularly in the amygdala and hippocampus
- **AMPA receptor potentiator** — enhances AMPA-mediated synaptic transmission, linking to neuroplasticity cascades

The opioid mechanism was definitively demonstrated when naltrexone (an opioid antagonist) fully blocked tianeptine's antidepressant effects in clinical studies.

### 4.2 Cognitive Enhancement Evidence

#### 4.2.1 Preclinical Evidence (Strong)

Tianeptine has demonstrated robust cognitive effects in animal models, primarily through stress-reversal and hippocampal plasticity mechanisms:

**Hippocampal neuroplasticity:**
- Tianeptine prevents and reverses stress-induced hippocampal atrophy — specifically, it restores dendritic length and branching of CA3 pyramidal neurons that are shortened by chronic stress (Watanabe et al., 1992; McEwen et al., 2010)
- Enhances hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) — the cellular substrate of learning and memory
- Restores neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus suppressed by chronic stress

**BDNF modulation:**
- Increases BDNF expression in hippocampus, reversing stress-induced BDNF downregulation
- Activates downstream TrkB-mTOR-ERK pathways supporting synaptic strengthening

**Behavioral outcomes in rodents:**
- Reverses chronic stress-induced spatial memory deficits (Morris water maze, radial arm maze)
- Normalizes stress-impaired novel object recognition
- Restores cognitive flexibility in attentional set-shifting paradigms after chronic unpredictable stress

#### 4.2.2 Clinical Evidence (Limited but Positive)

**Comparison with SSRIs on cognitive measures:**

- **Jeon et al. (2014; *Human Psychopharmacology*):** Tianeptine (37.5 mg/day) vs. escitalopram in elderly patients with depression. Both improved depression; tianeptine showed greater improvements in memory domains (word list recall, constructional praxis recall) on the CERAD neuropsychological battery.

- **Klasik et al. (2011):** Tianeptine demonstrated cognitive improvements in depressed patients including gains in attention, psychomotor speed, verbal fluency, and executive function, with a profile suggesting benefits beyond simple mood improvement.

- **Nickel et al. (2003; *European Psychiatry*):** Tianeptine improved cognitive performance in depressed patients, with benefits in processing speed and sustained attention.

**Cognitive effects in specific populations:**

- Multiple studies in elderly depressed populations report that tianeptine improves or preserves cognitive function — contrasting with SSRIs, which can produce cognitive dulling in some patients
- Tianeptine does not impair psychomotor performance, driving ability, or vigilance — a meaningful advantage over sedating antidepressants

**Stress-cognition interaction:**
- The strongest clinical signal is tianeptine's ability to protect cognition under stress conditions. In non-stressed healthy volunteers, cognitive enhancement effects are minimal. This parallels the preclinical literature showing robust effects only in stressed animals.

### 4.3 Safety and Regulatory Concerns

Tianeptine's mu-opioid agonism creates significant abuse and addiction liability:

- **FDA warnings (2018, updated 2022):** Multiple reports of abuse, dependence, and withdrawal symptoms at supratherapeutic doses (typically 100-1000+ mg/day vs. therapeutic 37.5 mg/day)
- **Scheduled substance:** Classified as a controlled substance in Michigan, Alabama, Minnesota, and several other US states as of 2025. Not FDA-approved in the United States.
- **Available by prescription** in France, Russia, and many other countries (brand names: Stablon, Coaxil, Tatinol)
- **Marketed as a supplement** in the US under names like "Tianaa," "ZaZa," and "gas station heroin" — presenting severe public health risks
- **Withdrawal syndrome:** Can be severe, resembling opioid withdrawal (anxiety, insomnia, myalgia, nausea, tachycardia), particularly at high doses
- At therapeutic doses (12.5 mg TID), abuse potential and side effects are reported as low in controlled medical settings

### 4.4 Summary Assessment

Tianeptine shows genuine nootropic-adjacent properties through its ability to protect and restore hippocampal function under chronic stress conditions. However:

1. Cognitive enhancement evidence in healthy, non-stressed humans is minimal
2. The clinical evidence is sparse (few RCTs, small samples)
3. Significant addiction liability limits its utility as a nootropic
4. Regulatory crackdown is ongoing due to widespread supratherapeutic abuse
5. The mu-opioid mechanism, while effective for mood, raises fundamentally different safety concerns compared to classical psychedelics (which have essentially no addiction potential)

---

## 5. Comparative Mechanisms

### 5.1 Shared Pathways

All four substances converge on neuroplasticity-related signaling, though through different entry points:

| Pathway | LSD | Psilocybin | DMT | Tianeptine |
|---------|-----|------------|-----|-----------|
| **5-HT2A agonism** | Primary (Ki ~1-3 nM) | Primary (Ki ~6 nM) | Primary (Ki ~75 nM) | None |
| **Mu-opioid agonism** | None | None | None | Primary (EC50 ~194 nM) |
| **Sigma-1 receptor** | Minimal | Minimal | Significant | None |
| **BDNF upregulation** | Yes (via 5-HT2A → glutamate) | Yes (direct TrkB + indirect) | Yes (demonstrated in RCT) | Yes (stress reversal) |
| **mTOR activation** | Yes (confirmed in humans) | Yes | Yes | Yes (indirect) |
| **Hippocampal neurogenesis** | Limited evidence | Limited evidence | Yes (S1R-mediated, confirmed in vivo) | Yes (stress reversal) |
| **DMN disruption** | Robust | Robust | Robust | None documented |
| **AMPA potentiation** | Indirect (via glutamate) | Indirect (via glutamate) | Indirect (via glutamate) | Direct |

### 5.2 Key Distinctions

**Psychedelics (LSD, psilocybin, DMT):**
- Cognitive effects are primarily *post-acute* (hours to weeks after dosing)
- Acute intoxication generally *impairs* deliberate cognitive performance
- Neuroplastic changes may be experience-dependent (psychological content during the "window" matters)
- Essentially no addiction potential; rapid tolerance (tachyphylaxis) prevents compulsive redosing
- Regulatory pathway: FDA breakthrough therapy designations; Phase 3 trials underway

**Tianeptine:**
- Cognitive effects are primarily *stress-protective* (prevents stress-induced deficits rather than enhancing baseline function)
- Does not impair acute cognitive performance
- Neuroplastic effects are hippocampus-specific and stress-dependent
- Significant addiction potential at supratherapeutic doses
- Regulatory trajectory: *increasing restriction* rather than clinical advancement in the US

## 6. Methodological Challenges

### 6.1 The Blinding Problem

The most fundamental challenge across psychedelic research is **functional unblinding**: participants can easily distinguish psychoactive substances from inert placebos. In the MDLSD trial, 72% of participants correctly guessed their condition. This inflates placebo-group expectations and confounds effect size estimation. Proposed solutions include:

- Active placebos (niacin flushing, low-dose methylphenidate)
- Self-blinding citizen science designs
- Bayesian expectancy modeling as a covariate
- Very low doses that produce ambiguous subjective effects

### 6.2 Small Sample Sizes

Most psychedelic cognitive studies have N < 60. The largest controlled trial (Szigeti et al., 2021; N=191) used a citizen-science design with uncontrolled drug potency. COMPASS's Phase 3 trials (N=258) are the first adequately powered studies, but these measure depression outcomes rather than cognition.

### 6.3 Heterogeneous Cognitive Batteries

Studies use widely varying cognitive assessments, making cross-study comparison difficult. A standardized psychedelic cognitive battery would advance the field considerably.

### 6.4 Ecological Validity

Laboratory cognitive tasks may not capture the kinds of real-world cognitive changes that users report — insight, creative problem-solving, perspective-taking, and flexible thinking in naturalistic contexts. However, subjective reports are also vulnerable to expectancy and confirmation bias.

## 7. Evidence Summary and Conclusions

### 7.1 Level of Evidence by Substance and Domain

| Substance | Microdosing Cognition | Full-Dose Cognition | Neuroplasticity | Addiction Risk | Clinical Stage |
|-----------|----------------------|--------------------|--------------------|----------------|----------------|
| **LSD** | No evidence of benefit (meta-analysis: d=-0.06) | Selective post-acute enhancement (memory, flexibility) | Strong mechanistic evidence | Essentially none | Phase 2b (GAD) |
| **Psilocybin** | Minimal/null (subtle divergent thinking signal) | Cognitive flexibility + neural reorganization (weeks) | Strong (TrkB binding, BDNF, mTOR) | Essentially none | Phase 3 (TRD) — NDA 2026 |
| **DMT/Ayahuasca** | Not studied | Memory enhancement; no impairment in long-term users | Strong (S1R neurogenesis, BDNF increase in RCT) | Essentially none | Phase 2a (MDD) |
| **Tianeptine** | N/A | Stress-protective; minimal in non-stressed humans | Strong preclinical (hippocampal LTP, BDNF) | Significant (mu-opioid) | Marketed (Europe); restricted (US) |

### 7.2 Key Takeaways

1. **Microdosing is not a nootropic.** The most rigorous evidence consistently finds no cognitive benefit from sub-perceptual psychedelic doses. Self-reported improvements are attributable to expectancy and placebo effects.

2. **Full-dose psychedelics produce selective, post-acute cognitive changes.** Enhanced cognitive flexibility, divergent thinking, and visuospatial memory emerge in the days to weeks following administration, coinciding with a neuroplastic window of enhanced BDNF-TrkB-mTOR signaling and brain network reorganization.

3. **The neuroplasticity signal is robust across substances.** All four compounds promote structural and functional neural plasticity through partially convergent pathways. Whether this translates to durable cognitive enhancement in healthy individuals — or only restoration of stress-impaired function — remains an open question.

4. **DMT's sigma-1 receptor mechanism is unique and promising.** The neurogenesis findings via S1R activation distinguish DMT from other psychedelics and suggest a mechanism for cognitive enhancement independent of the psychedelic experience itself.

5. **Tianeptine occupies a different risk-benefit space.** Its cognitive effects are real but stress-dependent, and its opioid mechanism introduces addiction liability fundamentally absent from the psychedelic compounds.

6. **The field needs larger, better-blinded studies with standardized cognitive batteries.** Most current evidence comes from small trials (N<60) with imperfect blinding and heterogeneous outcome measures.
