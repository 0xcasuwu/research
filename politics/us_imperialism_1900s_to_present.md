# From Anti-Imperialism to Corporate Empire: The Transformation of American Power and Democratic Discourse, 1900-2024

**A Political Science Research Paper**

---

## Abstract

This paper examines the radical transformation of United States imperial ambitions and domestic democratic norms from the turn of the 20th century to the present day. In the early 1900s, a vibrant Anti-Imperialist League challenged American territorial expansion abroad, reflecting broad societal debate about empire. By contrast, contemporary American power operates through economic hegemony, military presence in over 750 foreign bases, and corporate-state fusion legitimized by Supreme Court decisions like *Citizens United v. FEC* (2010). This paper argues that the shift from territorial imperialism to corporate-financial imperialism has coincided with the degradation of democratic participation and free speech, effectively creating a legally sanctioned oligarchy where concentrated wealth translates directly into political power. Through historical analysis and institutional examination, this research demonstrates how figures like Mitch McConnell have facilitated this transition by dismantling campaign finance regulations, while the Anti-Imperialist League's moral and constitutional arguments against empire have been entirely marginalized from mainstream political discourse.

## 1. Introduction

In 1898, when the United States acquired the Philippines, Puerto Rico, and Guam following the Spanish-American War, a powerful domestic opposition emerged that would fundamentally challenge the very concept of American empire. The Anti-Imperialist League, comprising prominent intellectuals, business leaders, and politicians including Mark Twain, Andrew Carnegie, and former President Grover Cleveland, articulated a principled opposition to territorial expansion on constitutional, moral, and practical grounds (Beisner, 1968). Their central argument was clear: a republic founded on consent of the governed could not righteously govern distant peoples without their consent.

Fast-forward 126 years to 2024, and the United States maintains the world's most extensive global military presence, with approximately 750 military bases in over 80 countries (Vine, 2020). American corporations dominate global markets, American financial institutions shape monetary policy worldwide through institutions like the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, and American military interventions—from Iraq to Afghanistan to Libya to Syria—have reshaped entire regions. Yet unlike the vigorous domestic debate of 1898-1920, contemporary imperial practices proceed with minimal democratic deliberation or dissent in mainstream political discourse.

This paper argues that this transformation reflects not merely a change in imperial tactics (from territorial acquisition to economic hegemony), but a fundamental restructuring of American democracy itself. The Supreme Court's decision in *Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission* (2010), which struck down restrictions on corporate political spending as violations of the First Amendment, represents the legal culmination of a decades-long project to equate money with speech and corporations with persons. Senator Mitch McConnell has been the principal political architect of this transformation, systematically dismantling campaign finance regulations and blocking reform efforts throughout his career (Dayen, 2021).

The result is what political scientists increasingly describe as an oligarchy—a system where a small wealthy elite exercises disproportionate political power (Gilens & Page, 2014). This domestic oligarchy is inseparable from American imperialism abroad: the same corporate interests that dominate domestic politics drive foreign policy toward protecting markets, securing resources, and maintaining dollar hegemony. Meanwhile, the free speech rights that the Anti-Imperialist League exercised to challenge empire have been paradoxically "expanded" to grant corporations unlimited political spending while grassroots organizing faces surveillance, suppression, and criminalization.

This paper proceeds in eight sections. Section 2 examines the Anti-Imperialist League's arguments and the robust democratic debate over empire in the early 20th century. Section 3 traces the mid-century shift from territorial to economic imperialism. Section 4 analyzes the *Citizens United* decision and its implications for democracy. Section 5 focuses on Mitch McConnell's role in dismantling campaign finance law. Section 6 maps the contemporary American empire in its military, economic, and corporate dimensions. Section 7 examines the degradation of free speech and democratic participation. Section 8 provides a comparative analysis of 1900 versus 2024. Section 9 concludes with reflections on the future of American democracy and empire.

## 2. The Anti-Imperialist League and the Debate Over Empire (1898-1920)

### 2.1 Formation and Composition

The Anti-Imperialist League was founded on June 15, 1898, in Boston, Massachusetts, in direct response to the Treaty of Paris, which would transfer control of the Philippines, Puerto Rico, and Guam from Spain to the United States. The League's membership was remarkably diverse, spanning political, economic, and ideological divisions:

- **Political leaders:** Former President Grover Cleveland, former President Benjamin Harrison, Senator George Hoar (R-MA), Speaker of the House Thomas Reed
- **Industrialists:** Andrew Carnegie (steel magnate), who donated substantial funds to anti-imperialist causes
- **Intellectuals and writers:** Mark Twain, William James, William Dean Howells, William Graham Sumner, Moorfield Storey
- **Labor leaders:** Samuel Gompers (American Federation of Labor)
- **Reformers and activists:** Jane Addams, Carl Schurz, Edward Atkinson

This coalition demonstrates that anti-imperialism was not a marginal position but a mainstream perspective that cut across party lines and economic interests (Tompkins, 1970).

### 2.2 Core Arguments Against Empire

The Anti-Imperialist League's arguments against territorial expansion were multifaceted:

#### Constitutional Arguments
The League argued that the Constitution provided no authorization for the United States to govern colonial subjects without their consent or without a path to statehood and citizenship. Senator George Hoar articulated this position powerfully:

> "The question with which we have to deal is not what we may do for these peoples, but what we may do to them... We have no right to acquire territory merely for the purpose of governing its inhabitants" (Hoar, 1899).

This constitutional argument held that imperialism violated the foundational American principle that governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed.

#### Moral and Racial Arguments
While some anti-imperialists held racist views about the capacity of Filipinos or Puerto Ricans for self-government, the League's official position emphasized universal human rights and self-determination. Mark Twain's satirical essays savagely mocked the hypocrisy of imposing American rule on unwilling populations:

> "We have gone to conquer, not to redeem... We have pacified some thousands of the islanders and buried them; destroyed their fields; burned their villages, and turned their widows and orphans out-of-doors" (Twain, 1901).

Twain's "To the Person Sitting in Darkness" (1901) and "The War Prayer" (unpublished until 1923) directly challenged the missionary rhetoric used to justify conquest.

#### Economic Arguments
Andrew Carnegie and other business leaders argued that empire was economically irrational. Maintaining colonies required military expenditure, invited foreign conflicts, and created moral hazards. Carnegie famously offered to personally purchase the Philippines' independence for $20 million—the price the U.S. had paid Spain—to prevent American colonial rule (Carnegie, 1898).

William Graham Sumner, in his essay "The Conquest of the United States by Spain" (1899), argued that imperialism would corrupt American institutions:

> "We have beaten Spain in a military conflict, but we are submitting to be conquered by her on the field of ideas and policies" (Sumner, 1899).

#### Strategic Arguments
Some anti-imperialists argued that distant territorial possessions created strategic vulnerabilities rather than strengths. They predicted (correctly) that the Philippines would become a liability in Asian geopolitics and would provoke conflict with rising powers like Japan.

### 2.3 The Philippine-American War and the Limits of Anti-Imperialism

Despite the League's efforts, the Treaty of Paris was ratified by the Senate on February 6, 1899, by a narrow margin of 57-27—just one vote more than the required two-thirds majority. The Philippine-American War (1899-1902, with insurgency continuing until 1913) demonstrated the brutal reality of colonial conquest. Between 200,000 and 1,000,000 Filipino civilians died due to violence, famine, and disease during the war—a scale of suffering that gave ammunition to anti-imperialist arguments (Kramer, 2006).

The Anti-Imperialist League published photographs, eyewitness accounts, and military correspondence documenting atrocities, torture, and civilian massacres. They challenged censorship and government propaganda. Yet they ultimately failed to prevent American colonial expansion.

### 2.4 The Significance of Public Debate

What is most striking from a 2024 perspective is not whether the Anti-Imperialist League succeeded, but that such a debate occurred at all. Major newspapers extensively covered both pro- and anti-imperialist arguments. Presidential elections (1900, 1904) featured imperial policy as a central issue. Public intellectuals, religious leaders, and politicians staked their reputations on opposing or supporting empire. Congress vigorously debated the constitutional and moral questions involved.

This stands in stark contrast to the 21st century, when:
- The Iraq War (2003) was launched on false pretenses with minimal Congressional debate
- Drone warfare operates with no geographic limits and minimal public accountability
- Military operations occur in Syria, Yemen, Somalia, Niger, and elsewhere without Congressional authorization
- The national security state operates with vast surveillance powers and minimal oversight

The vitality of early 20th-century anti-imperialism reveals how far contemporary American democracy has degraded in its capacity to debate and constrain imperial power.

## 3. From Territorial to Economic Imperialism: The Mid-20th Century Shift

### 3.1 The Post-WWII American Empire

The United States emerged from World War II as the preeminent global power. Rather than pursuing territorial expansion in the classical European colonial model, American policymakers constructed a system of economic and military hegemony that was arguably more effective and less politically costly.

#### The Bretton Woods System
The 1944 Bretton Woods Conference established institutions (International Monetary Fund, World Bank) that would structure the global economy around American interests and the U.S. dollar as reserve currency. This "dollarization" of global trade gave the United States extraordinary power to:
- Finance deficits by printing currency that others must hold
- Impose sanctions by denying access to dollar-denominated transactions
- Extract seigniorage—the profit from currency creation—from the global economy

#### Military Basing Infrastructure
The United States established permanent military bases across Western Europe, Japan, South Korea, and elsewhere. These bases served multiple functions:
- Projecting military power globally
- Securing sea lanes and resources (especially oil)
- Providing leverage over allied governments
- Creating perpetual demand for American military equipment and contractors

By 2024, this network encompasses approximately 750 bases in over 80 countries—more than all other countries combined (Vine, 2020).

### 3.2 Covert Operations and Regime Change

Where direct military intervention was politically costly, the CIA and other agencies orchestrated coups and interventions:

- **Iran (1953):** Overthrow of democratically elected Prime Minister Mohammad Mossadegh to protect British and American oil interests
- **Guatemala (1954):** Overthrow of democratically elected President Jacobo Árbenz to protect United Fruit Company holdings
- **Congo (1961):** Assassination of Prime Minister Patrice Lumumba
- **Chile (1973):** Support for military coup against democratically elected President Salvador Allende
- **Nicaragua (1980s):** Support for Contra rebels against Sandinista government

These operations were conducted with minimal democratic accountability. Unlike the Philippine-American War, which faced vigorous domestic opposition, Cold War interventions occurred largely in secret or were justified through anti-communist rhetoric that suppressed dissent.

### 3.3 Corporate Integration with Empire

The post-WWII period saw increasing integration between corporate interests and foreign policy:

- **Oil companies** shaped Middle East policy through relationships with the State Department and CIA
- **United Fruit Company** (now Chiquita) influenced Central American policy through lobbying and connections to the Dulles brothers
- **Defense contractors** developed revolving-door relationships with the Pentagon, creating what President Eisenhower termed the "military-industrial complex"

Eisenhower's 1961 farewell address warning remains prescient:

> "In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex. The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist" (Eisenhower, 1961).

Yet despite this warning from a five-star general and two-term president, the military-industrial complex has only grown more powerful and more deeply integrated into American politics and economy.

### 3.4 The Neoliberal Turn

The 1970s-1990s saw the consolidation of what critics term "neoliberal imperialism"—the use of international institutions, debt, and "structural adjustment" to open foreign economies to American capital:

- **Debt crises** in Latin America and Africa gave the IMF and World Bank leverage to impose privatization, deregulation, and austerity
- **Trade agreements** (NAFTA, WTO) protected corporate intellectual property and investor rights while undermining labor and environmental protections
- **"Shock therapy"** in post-Soviet states transferred public assets to oligarchs connected to Western financial institutions

This system was more effective than traditional colonialism: rather than the expense of direct administration, American corporations and financial institutions could extract wealth through "market mechanisms" backed by international law and, when necessary, military force.

### 3.5 The Absence of Anti-Imperialist Opposition

Crucially, this entire transformation occurred with virtually no domestic political opposition comparable to the Anti-Imperialist League. Why?

1. **Cold War consensus:** Anti-imperialism was conflated with communism and thus politically marginalized
2. **Corporate media:** Concentration of media ownership aligned news coverage with corporate interests
3. **Prosperity:** Post-war economic growth created a middle class with limited interest in foreign policy
4. **Secrecy:** Covert operations and classified national security apparatus prevented democratic accountability

By the end of the 20th century, American imperialism had become simultaneously more extensive and less visible than in 1900.

## 4. Citizens United and the Corporate Capture of Democracy

### 4.1 Background: The Erosion of Campaign Finance Law

The modern campaign finance regulatory system began with the Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA) of 1971, amended in 1974 following Watergate. These reforms established:
- Contribution limits to candidates and parties
- Public disclosure requirements
- Public financing for presidential campaigns
- The Federal Election Commission to enforce regulations

The Supreme Court's *Buckley v. Valeo* (1976) decision established the framework that would ultimately lead to *Citizens United*. The Court held that:
- Campaign spending is protected speech under the First Amendment
- Therefore, limits on campaign spending (as opposed to contributions) are unconstitutional
- But contribution limits are permissible to prevent corruption or its appearance

This created a distinction between contributions (regulable) and expenditures (protected speech) that would structure all subsequent campaign finance jurisprudence.

### 4.2 Citizens United v. FEC (2010): The Decision

*Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission* 558 U.S. 310 (2010) overturned decades of precedent restricting corporate political spending. The case originated when the nonprofit corporation Citizens United sought to air a film critical of Hillary Clinton during the 2008 Democratic primary, which would have violated the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act's (BCRA, "McCain-Feingold") restrictions on corporate electioneering communications.

In a 5-4 decision written by Justice Anthony Kennedy, the Court held:

1. **Corporate independent expenditures are protected speech:** The First Amendment prohibits government from restricting independent political expenditures by corporations, labor unions, and other associations
2. **Corporate personhood:** For purposes of political speech, corporations possess the same rights as natural persons
3. **Anti-corruption rationale is narrow:** The only governmental interest strong enough to justify restrictions is preventing quid pro quo corruption, not the broader concern about corporate influence

Justice Kennedy's opinion contains the remarkable assertion:

> "The appearance of influence or access, furthermore, will not cause the electorate to lose faith in our democracy" (Citizens United, 558 U.S. at 360).

This statement would prove spectacularly wrong, as public trust in government and democratic institutions has plummeted in the *Citizens United* era.

### 4.3 The Dissent: Justice Stevens' Warning

Justice John Paul Stevens' 90-page dissent, joined by Justices Ginsburg, Breyer, and Sotomayor, presciently warned of the decision's consequences:

> "The Court's ruling threatens to undermine the integrity of elected institutions across the Nation. The path it has taken to reach its outcome will, I fear, do damage to this institution... A democracy cannot function effectively when its constituent members believe laws are being bought and sold" (Citizens United, 558 U.S. at 396, Stevens, J., dissenting).

Stevens systematically dismantled the majority's reasoning:

1. **Corporations are not persons:** "Corporations have no consciences, no beliefs, no feelings, no thoughts, no desires... they are not themselves members of 'We the People' by whom and for whom our Constitution was established" (Citizens United, 558 U.S. at 466).

2. **Corporate spending distorts democracy:** Unlimited corporate spending will drown out individual voices and shift policy toward corporate interests.

3. **Stare decisis:** The majority abandoned precedent without adequate justification, undermining the Court's legitimacy.

### 4.4 Immediate Consequences

The impact of *Citizens United* was immediate and dramatic:

#### Rise of Super PACs
Within months, federal courts extended *Citizens United* to permit "Super PACs"—political action committees that can raise unlimited funds from corporations, unions, and individuals, provided they don't coordinate directly with candidates. The *SpeechNow.org v. FEC* decision (D.C. Cir. 2010) reasoned that if independent expenditures cannot corrupt, then contributions to groups making only independent expenditures cannot corrupt either.

This created a system where:
- Candidates maintain nominal campaign committees with contribution limits
- But allied Super PACs raise and spend unlimited funds
- Wealthy donors can write checks for millions of dollars
- The "no coordination" requirement is routinely evaded through various mechanisms

#### Dark Money Explosion
*Citizens United* permitted corporations to spend unlimited amounts, but disclosure requirements remained. This incentivized spending through 501(c)(4) "social welfare" organizations that don't disclose donors. The result:

- 2008 election (pre-*Citizens United*): $338 million in outside spending
- 2012 election: $1.4 billion in outside spending
- 2020 election: $3.1 billion in outside spending (OpenSecrets, 2021)

"Dark money"—spending where the original source is hidden—increased from $5.2 million in 2006 to over $1 billion in 2020 (Issue One, 2021).

#### Wealth Concentration and Political Power
The concentration of political spending mirrors the concentration of wealth:

- In 2020, the top 100 donors gave more to Super PACs than all 4.6 million small donors combined (Blumenthal, 2021)
- The wealthiest 0.01% of Americans (about 31,000 people) account for 40% of all campaign contributions (Bonica et al., 2013)
- Just 25 mega-donors and their spouses contributed 47% of Super PAC spending in 2016 (Mayersohn & Beckel, 2017)

### 4.5 Theoretical Implications: From Democracy to Oligarchy

*Citizens United* doesn't merely increase the role of money in politics—it fundamentally transforms the nature of American democracy.

#### Plutocracy vs. Democracy: The Empirical Case for Oligarchy

Political scientists Martin Gilens (Princeton) and Benjamin Page (Northwestern) conducted a groundbreaking analysis of 1,779 policy issues spanning two decades to test competing theories of American democracy. Their 2014 study tested four models: Majoritarian Electoral Democracy, Economic-Elite Domination, Majoritarian Pluralism, and Biased Pluralism. The findings were stark:

> "The preferences of the average American appear to have only a minuscule, near-zero, statistically non-significant impact upon public policy... Economic elites and organized groups representing business interests have substantial independent impacts on U.S. government policy, while average citizens and mass-based interest groups have little or no independent influence" (Gilens & Page, 2014, p. 575).

More specifically, their analysis revealed that when economic elites and mass-based interest groups disagree, economic elites win overwhelmingly. When average citizens' preferences diverge from elite preferences, policy follows elite preferences approximately 70% of the time. Most damningly, they found that "not only do ordinary citizens not have uniquely substantial power over policy decisions, they have little or no independent influence on policy at all."

This empirical finding—based on rigorous quantitative analysis rather than anecdote—demonstrates that the United States functions as an oligarchy where policy systematically reflects elite preferences regardless of majority opinion. The study effectively falsifies the "median voter theorem" that undergirds liberal democratic theory. Voting, in this system, becomes largely ceremonial: citizens can choose between candidates, but those candidates, once elected, respond primarily to elite donors and organized business interests rather than voter preferences.

#### The Inversion of Free Speech
*Citizens United* inverts the First Amendment's purpose. Originally, free speech protections aimed to enable democratic participation, especially for dissidents and marginalized groups. *Citizens United* transforms free speech into a tool of elite domination:

- **Positive liberty becomes negative liberty:** Instead of empowering citizens to participate, "free speech" becomes freedom from regulation for the powerful
- **Institutional speakers drown out individuals:** Corporate "speech" through billions in advertising overwhelms individual voices
- **Money becomes speech:** Equating spending with expression means those with more money have more "speech"

As legal scholar Ronald Dworkin argued, this represents a fundamental misunderstanding:

> "The nerve of the Court's argument is... that corporations and labor unions have First Amendment rights. But they do not... If we abandon the distinction between citizens and corporations, we blur the line between individual human beings and artificial legal constructions that exist only to serve us" (Dworkin, 2010).

#### Creating Legal Oligarchy and "Inverted Totalitarianism"

Most importantly, *Citizens United* creates what can be termed "legal oligarchy"—oligarchic power not through autocracy or corruption, but through formally legal mechanisms:

1. **Wealth concentration** creates a small class with resources to dominate political spending
2. **Citizens United** makes unlimited political spending a constitutional right
3. **Super PACs and dark money** provide vehicles for translating wealth into political power
4. **Resulting policy** serves elite interests, further concentrating wealth
5. **Feedback loop** continuously strengthens oligarchic power

This system is self-reinforcing and legally protected, making it more stable and harder to challenge than informal corruption.

Political theorist Sheldon Wolin termed this system "inverted totalitarianism" in his seminal work *Democracy Incorporated* (2008). Unlike classical totalitarianism, which features a charismatic leader, mass mobilization, and ideological fervor, inverted totalitarianism operates through corporate anonymity, political demobilization, and manufactured consent:

> "One cannot point to any national institution[s] that can accurately be described as democratic... the highly managed, money-saturated elections, the lobby-infested Congress, the imperial presidency, the class-biased judicial and penal system, or, least of all, the media" (Wolin, 2008).

Where classical totalitarianism subordinated economics to politics, inverted totalitarianism reverses this relationship: "Economics dominates politics—and with that domination comes different forms of ruthlessness." The result is what Wolin calls "managed democracy"—"a political form in which governments are legitimated by elections that they have learned to control."

Critically, inverted totalitarianism "does not find its expression in a demagogue or charismatic leader but in the faceless anonymity of the corporate state." Power operates not through the Führerprinzip but through quarterly earnings reports, lobbyist influence, and the revolving door between government and corporate boardrooms. Citizens remain formally free—free to vote, speak, and assemble—but these freedoms operate within parameters so constrained by corporate power that they cannot threaten elite interests.

Wolin's framework illuminates how *Citizens United* represents not an aberration but the legal codification of inverted totalitarianism. By constitutionalizing corporate political spending, the Court transformed what had been an informal corporate dominance into an explicit legal regime immune to democratic reform.

## 5. Mitch McConnell: Architect of the Post-Democratic Order

### 5.1 Early Career and Ideological Formation

Addison Mitchell McConnell III was elected to the Senate in 1984 from Kentucky. From his earliest years in the Senate, McConnell focused obsessively on campaign finance—not to reform it, but to dismantle all restrictions on political spending. His opposition to campaign finance regulation became the defining project of his career.

McConnell's ideological commitment to unlimited political spending stems from a particular interpretation of the First Amendment: any restriction on political spending, no matter how aimed at preventing corruption, constitutes impermissible speech restriction. This absolutist position places him well outside the mainstream of constitutional law but at the center of conservative legal movement thinking.

### 5.2 Leading the Fight Against McCain-Feingold

The Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 (BCRA, "McCain-Feingold") represented the most significant campaign finance reform in decades. The law:
- Banned unlimited "soft money" contributions to national parties
- Restricted corporate and union "electioneering communications" within 60 days of general elections
- Required disclosure of major donors

McConnell led the opposition, calling McCain-Feingold "an incumbency protection racket" and vowing to fight it through the courts. On the day President Bush signed the bill, McConnell filed suit: *McConnell v. Federal Election Commission* (2003).

In a 5-4 decision, the Supreme Court upheld most of BCRA. But McConnell's litigation strategy would eventually succeed when the Court's composition changed.

### 5.3 Strategic Court Appointments

As Senate Majority Leader (2015-2021) and Minority Leader, McConnell's most consequential actions concerned judicial appointments:

#### Blocking Merrick Garland (2016)
When Justice Antonin Scalia died on February 13, 2016, President Obama nominated centrist Judge Merrick Garland. McConnell refused to hold hearings or a vote, inventing a "principle" that Supreme Court vacancies shouldn't be filled in presidential election years.

This unprecedented obstruction held the seat open for President Trump to fill with Neil Gorsuch, shifting the Court rightward.

#### Rushing Amy Coney Barrett (2020)
When Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg died on September 18, 2020—just 46 days before the presidential election—McConnell abandoned his invented "principle" and rushed through Amy Coney Barrett's confirmation, completing the process in just 27 days.

#### Transforming the Lower Courts
Beyond the Supreme Court, McConnell prioritized confirming young conservative judges to lifetime appointments:
- 234 Article III judges confirmed under Trump (including 54 appellate judges)
- Focus on candidates vetted by the Federalist Society
- Many nominees rated "not qualified" by the American Bar Association confirmed anyway

This judicial transformation ensures that even if Democrats control elected branches, the courts will strike down progressive legislation and uphold unlimited political spending for decades.

### 5.4 McConnell's Role in Citizens United

While McConnell wasn't a party to *Citizens United*, his decades-long litigation and advocacy created the legal and political environment that made the decision possible:

1. **Ideological groundwork:** McConnell's speeches, writings, and litigation consistently advanced the theory that political spending restrictions violate free speech
2. **Judicial appointments:** Supporting conservative justices who would adopt this interpretation
3. **Political cover:** Making opposition to campaign finance reform a respectable Republican position

After *Citizens United*, McConnell celebrated:

> "For too long, some in this country have been deprived of full participation in the political process. With today's monumental decision, the Supreme Court took an important step in the direction of restoring the First Amendment rights of these groups" (McConnell, 2010).

Note the Orwellian inversion: corporations denied "full participation" in politics are the victims; unlimited spending is a "right" being "restored."

### 5.5 Blocking Reform Efforts

Even as public opinion turned strongly against *Citizens United* (polls consistently show 70-80% opposition, including majorities of Republicans), McConnell blocked all reform efforts:

#### DISCLOSE Act
The Democracy Is Strengthened by Casting Light On Spending in Elections (DISCLOSE) Act would require disclosure of major donors to Super PACs and politically active nonprofits. It has been introduced repeatedly since 2010 and has never received a vote in McConnell's Senate, despite majority support.

McConnell's stated reason: disclosure would "chill speech" by subjecting donors to criticism. This inverts the traditional understanding that anonymity enables corruption and transparency protects democracy.

#### Constitutional Amendment
A constitutional amendment to overturn *Citizens United* (H.J.Res.21, S.J.Res.18) has repeatedly been introduced with majority support. In 2014, the Senate voted 54-42 in favor, short of the 67 votes needed. McConnell has ensured no vote occurs when Republicans control the Senate.

Public polling shows 70-75% of Americans support such an amendment, including majorities of Republicans. Yet McConnell views popular will as irrelevant when it conflicts with his ideological project.

### 5.6 Personal Financial Interests

McConnell's opposition to campaign finance reform has served his political interests:

- His 2020 reelection campaign raised $89 million, much from outside Kentucky
- Senate Leadership Fund (Super PAC aligned with McConnell) spent $340 million in 2020
- McConnell's wife, Elaine Chao, served as Transportation Secretary (2017-2021), during which time Kentucky received significant federal infrastructure funding
- The Chao family's shipping business has extensive connections to Chinese interests, raising conflict-of-interest questions

While these connections don't prove corruption in a legal sense, they illustrate how unlimited political spending creates an ecosystem where wealthy interests, Super PACs, and politicians form self-reinforcing networks.

### 5.7 McConnell's Legacy: Institutionalizing Oligarchy

McConnell's career demonstrates how an ideologically committed minority can transform democratic institutions:

1. **Patience:** Decades-long focus on courts and campaign finance
2. **Procedural ruthlessness:** Willingness to break norms (Garland blockade, filibuster elimination for judges)
3. **Ideological clarity:** Never wavering from the goal of unlimited political spending
4. **Strategic vision:** Understanding that judicial appointments lock in policy preferences beyond democratic accountability

The result is a system where:
- Wealth translates directly into political power (via unlimited spending)
- Courts protect this arrangement as constitutionally required
- Reform is nearly impossible (requiring constitutional amendment)
- Feedback loops continually strengthen oligarchic power

McConnell didn't create this system alone, but no single figure has done more to construct and protect it.

## 6. The New American Empire: Military, Economic, and Corporate Dimensions

### 6.1 The Global Military Footprint

Contemporary American imperialism is fundamentally different from the territorial imperialism the Anti-Imperialist League opposed, yet it is arguably more extensive:

#### Permanent Basing Infrastructure
As of 2024, the United States maintains approximately:
- **750 military bases** in over 80 countries (Vine, 2020)
- **173,000 troops** deployed in 159 countries (Department of Defense, 2023)
- **Aircraft carrier strike groups** capable of projecting power anywhere within days
- **Global surveillance networks** monitoring communications worldwide

This infrastructure costs approximately $150-200 billion annually beyond the core defense budget—what David Vine calls the "true costs of empire" (Vine, 2020).

#### Permanent War
Since 2001, the United States has been in a state of continuous warfare:
- **Afghanistan** (2001-2021): 20-year occupation costing $2.3 trillion
- **Iraq** (2003-2011, 2014-present): Invasion, occupation, and ongoing operations costing $2 trillion
- **Syria** (2014-present): Ongoing military operations without Congressional authorization
- **Libya** (2011): NATO intervention leading to state collapse
- **Yemen** (2002-present): Drone strikes and support for Saudi coalition
- **Somalia** (2007-present): Ongoing counterterrorism operations
- **Niger, Chad, Mali, etc.:** Expanding African operations

The Costs of War Project at Brown University estimates total post-9/11 war spending at $8 trillion, with approximately 900,000 deaths (Crawford, 2021).

Crucially, these wars operate with minimal democratic accountability:
- No Congressional declaration of war since 1942
- Authorization for Use of Military Force (2001) used to justify operations worldwide
- "Covert" operations never publicly acknowledged
- Media coverage increasingly minimal and uncritical

### 6.2 Economic Hegemony and Dollar Imperialism

American economic power operates through multiple interconnected mechanisms:

#### Dollar as Reserve Currency
Approximately 60% of global foreign exchange reserves are held in dollars, giving the United States extraordinary power:
- **Seigniorage:** The U.S. can print dollars that others must hold, essentially taxing the global economy
- **Sanctions power:** Denying access to dollar transactions effectively excludes entities from global trade
- **Deficit financing:** Foreign central banks purchase U.S. Treasury bonds, financing American deficits at low interest rates

Economist Michael Hudson terms this "super-imperialism"—the ability to extract wealth through monetary mechanisms rather than direct exploitation (Hudson, 2021).

#### International Financial Institutions
The IMF, World Bank, and regional development banks operate nominally as multilateral institutions but reflect American interests:
- **Voting shares:** The U.S. holds veto power over major decisions
- **Leadership:** Informal agreement that World Bank president is always American
- **Conditionality:** Loans require "structural adjustment"—privatization, deregulation, austerity—that opens economies to American capital

These institutions have facilitated the extraction of trillions in wealth from the Global South through debt servicing, capital flight, and asset transfers.

#### Trade Agreements and Investor Rights
Modern trade agreements extend far beyond tariff reduction:
- **Investor-State Dispute Settlement (ISDS):** Allows corporations to sue governments in private tribunals for policies that reduce expected profits
- **Intellectual property:** TRIPS agreement extends patent monopolies, transferring wealth to pharmaceutical and tech corporations
- **Deregulation requirements:** Restrict governments' ability to regulate corporations

These agreements constitute a "corporate bill of rights" that supersedes democratic sovereignty (Public Citizen, 2021).

### 6.3 Corporate Integration with Foreign Policy

Contemporary imperialism is inseparable from corporate interests:

#### Resource Extraction
- **Oil and gas:** Middle East policy shaped by ExxonMobil, Chevron, etc.
- **Rare earth minerals:** African and Latin American policy influenced by mining interests
- **Agricultural land:** Land grabs facilitated by USAID and development banks

#### Corporate Lobbying: Purchasing Foreign Policy

The scale of corporate lobbying reveals how thoroughly business interests dominate policy formation. In 2024, corporate lobbying spending reached a record-breaking $4.4 billion, continuing an upward trend that has seen lobbying expenditures increase by over $1 billion in the past decade (OpenSecrets, 2025). Since 2015, nearly $37 billion has been spent on federal lobbying.

Key sectors demonstrate the corporate-imperial nexus:

- **Pharmaceuticals and health products:** Spent $384.5 million in 2024 alone, and over $6.1 billion from 1999-2024. This industry shapes international intellectual property regimes through TRIPS agreements, extracting monopoly rents globally.

- **Oil and gas:** Spent $151.1 million in 2024, directly influencing Middle East military policy, climate negotiations, and sanctions regimes that protect petroleum interests.

- **Defense contractors:** Maintain permanent lobbying operations ensuring military budgets continue expanding regardless of strategic need. The revolving door between Pentagon and contractors is so routine it barely generates comment.

Individual organizations like the National Association of Realtors spent over $86.3 million on lobbying in 2024—more than the entire annual budgets of many advocacy organizations. This asymmetric spending power means corporate interests structurally dominate policy deliberations. Every policy debate occurs within parameters defined by corporate lobbying: what is "realistic," "moderate," or "responsible" reflects corporate preferences rather than democratic deliberation.

#### Arms Sales
The United States is the world's largest arms exporter, with $175 billion in sales in 2020:
- **Saudi Arabia:** Received $24.5 billion in U.S. weapons (2015-2019), used in Yemen war
- **Israel:** Receives $3.8 billion annually in military aid, all spent on U.S. weapons
- **Revolving door:** Defense contractors employ former government officials; officials join contractors after government service

This creates incentives for perpetual war: defense contractors profit from conflict, lobby for policies that create more conflict, and employ former officials who shape policy to generate future contracts. The result is institutionalized militarism that transcends partisan politics.

#### Tech Sector and Surveillance
Silicon Valley is deeply integrated with intelligence and military operations:
- **Amazon Web Services:** Hosts CIA's $600 million cloud contract
- **Palantir:** Provides data analytics to ICE, NSA, and military
- **Google, Microsoft, etc.:** Compete for $10 billion Pentagon cloud contract (JEDI)

The result is a "military-industrial-tech complex" where surveillance capitalism and national security state merge.

### 6.4 Comparative Scale: 1900 vs. 2024

In 1900, American "empire" consisted of:
- **Philippines, Puerto Rico, Guam:** Acquired 1898, total population ~10 million
- **Hawai'i:** Annexed 1898
- **Various Pacific islands:** Midway, Wake, etc.
- **Cuba:** Nominally independent but under U.S. control via Platt Amendment

This was a relatively modest empire by European standards, and it generated fierce domestic opposition.

By 2024, American power encompasses:
- **Military presence** in 159 countries
- **750 bases** in over 80 countries
- **Economic influence** through IMF, World Bank, dollar hegemony
- **Corporate dominance** in finance, technology, pharmaceuticals, agriculture, arms
- **Cultural hegemony** through Hollywood, social media, English language

Yet this vastly more extensive empire generates almost no domestic opposition in mainstream politics. No contemporary equivalent of the Anti-Imperialist League exists with comparable resources, access, or influence.

## 7. The Degradation of Free Speech and Democratic Norms

### 7.1 The Paradox: Citizens United "Expands" Free Speech While Dissent is Suppressed

*Citizens United* purports to expand free speech by removing restrictions on corporate political spending. Yet this "expansion" coincides with the systematic suppression of grassroots speech and organizing:

#### Surveillance of Activists
Post-9/11 surveillance apparatus is routinely directed at domestic activists:
- **Occupy Wall Street:** Extensive FBI and NYPD surveillance, infiltration, and coordination with banks
- **Black Lives Matter:** FBI classified as "domestic terrorism," subjected to COINTELPRO-style disruption
- **Environmental activists:** Designated "eco-terrorists," subjected to material support prosecution
- **Anti-war activists:** FBI surveillance, grand jury harassment, no-fly lists

#### Criminalization of Protest
Legislation across states criminalizes protest activities:
- **Anti-BDS laws:** 35 states require contractors to certify they won't boycott Israel
- **Pipeline protest laws:** Felony charges for infrastructure protest (Texas HB 3557)
- **Riot enhancement:** Expanding "riot" definitions to criminalize protest (Florida HB 1)

#### Corporate SLAPP Suits
Corporations use Strategic Lawsuits Against Public Participation to silence critics:
- **Energy Transfer Partners:** Sued Greenpeace for $900 million over Dakota Access Pipeline protests
- **Chevron:** Used RICO charges against lawyer representing Ecuadorian plaintiffs
- **Murray Energy:** Filed defamation suits against critics of coal industry

These suits rarely succeed on the merits but drain resources and create chilling effects.

### 7.2 The Inversion: Money is Speech, But Speech Without Money is Invisible

*Citizens United* establishes that spending money is speech. The logical implication: those with more money have more "speech." This creates a tiered system:

#### Tier 1: Corporate Speech
- Billions spent on advertising, lobbying, astroturf campaigns
- Direct access to policymakers through contributions
- Legal departments to navigate regulations

#### Tier 2: Wealthy Individual Speech
- Super PAC contributions
- Direct candidate support
- Access to media and policymakers

#### Tier 3: Middle-Class Speech
- Small-dollar contributions
- Voting (when not suppressed)
- Limited organizing capacity

#### Tier 4: Poor and Marginalized Speech
- Voting (heavily suppressed through ID laws, purges, felony disenfranchisement)
- Protest (criminalized and surveilled)
- Essentially excluded from "democratic" participation

This hierarchy means "free speech" in practice means freedom for the powerful while marginalized voices are systematically excluded.

### 7.3 Media Concentration and the Manufacture of Consent

The consolidation of media ownership ensures that even nominally "free" speech occurs within narrow parameters:

#### Ownership Concentration
- **Six corporations** control 90% of American media (Comcast, Disney, ViacomCBS, News Corp, AT&T, Sony)
- **Local news collapse:** Over 2,100 newspapers closed since 2004; "news deserts" expanding
- **Digital platforms:** Facebook and Google capture 60%+ of digital advertising, controlling information distribution

#### Manufactured Consent
Herman and Chomsky's "propaganda model" (1988) explains how nominally free media systematically serves elite interests:

1. **Profit orientation:** Media are businesses seeking profit
2. **Advertising:** Advertisers (corporations) are the customers; audiences are the product
3. **Sourcing:** Official sources (government, corporate PR) dominate
4. **Flak:** Organized campaigns punish dissenting coverage
5. **Ideology:** Anti-communism (now "terrorism," "extremism") marginalizes radical critique

The result: vigorous debate within narrow parameters that don't threaten fundamental interests.

### 7.4 The Algorithmic Control of Information

Digital platforms add a new dimension to information control:

#### Engagement Optimization
Algorithms optimize for engagement (clicks, shares, time-on-platform), which favors:
- Emotionally provocative content
- Confirmation of existing beliefs
- Sensationalism over substance
- Short-term outrage over long-term understanding

#### Ideological Filtering
While platforms claim neutrality, their algorithms systematically shape information:
- **YouTube's recommendation algorithm** radicalizes users toward extremism (Tufekci, 2018)
- **Facebook's News Feed** determines what information users see
- **Twitter's trending topics** shape public discourse

#### Surveillance Capitalism
Shoshana Zuboff's concept of "surveillance capitalism" describes how platforms:
- Extract behavioral data
- Develop predictive models of individual behavior
- Sell predictions to advertisers (and political campaigns)
- Modify behavior through personalized manipulation

This creates what Zuboff calls "instrumentarian power"—the ability to shape human behavior at scale without coercion (Zuboff, 2019).

### 7.5 Comparing 1900 and 2024: Free Speech in Theory and Practice

#### 1900: Limited Rights, Robust Debate

In 1900:
- **Formal rights:** First Amendment not yet incorporated against states; limited protection
- **Actual practice:** Vigorous public debate, diverse newspaper landscape, active political movements
- **Anti-Imperialist League:** Could effectively challenge government policy through publications, speeches, organizing

#### 2024: Expansive Rights, Constrained Debate

In 2024:
- **Formal rights:** Broad First Amendment protection (especially for corporations post-*Citizens United*)
- **Actual practice:** Debate constrained by media concentration, algorithmic filtering, surveillance, criminalization
- **Anti-imperial movements:** Marginal, under-resourced, facing surveillance and suppression

The paradox: formal free speech rights have expanded while the practical ability to challenge empire has contracted.

### 7.6 The Degradation of Democratic Norms

Beyond free speech, broader democratic norms have degraded:

#### Voter Suppression
Following *Shelby County v. Holder* (2013), which gutted Voting Rights Act preclearance:
- **1,000+ polling places closed** in formerly covered jurisdictions
- **Voter ID laws** disenfranchising millions
- **Voter roll purges** removing legitimate voters
- **Felony disenfranchisement** affecting 5.2 million, disproportionately Black Americans

#### Gerrymandering
Partisan gerrymandering creates legislative majorities contrary to vote shares:
- **Wisconsin:** Republicans won 64% of assembly seats with 46% of votes (2018)
- **North Carolina:** Gerrymandering entrenched Republican control despite narrow vote margins
- *Rucho v. Common Cause* (2019) held partisan gerrymandering non-justiciable

#### Electoral College
The Electoral College has twice in 20 years (2000, 2016) installed presidents who lost the popular vote, undermining democratic legitimacy.

#### Senate Malapportionment
50 Democratic senators represent 41 million more people than 50 Republican senators, yet have equal power. This structural bias amplifies conservative power and enables McConnell-style obstruction.

#### Filibuster
The Senate filibuster allows a minority to block legislation, creating a supermajority requirement for most policy. McConnell used this to obstruct Obama-era legislation systematically.

These structural features mean American democracy increasingly operates as minoritarian rule—power exercised by a minority through gerrymandering, voter suppression, and counter-majoritarian institutions.

## 8. Comparative Analysis: 1900 vs. 2024

### 8.1 Imperial Scope and Method

| Dimension | 1900 | 2024 |
|-----------|------|------|
| **Territorial holdings** | Philippines, Puerto Rico, Guam, Hawai'i | Puerto Rico, Guam, U.S. Virgin Islands, American Samoa, Northern Mariana Islands (plus dozens of smaller territories) |
| **Military bases abroad** | Minimal | ~750 bases in 80+ countries |
| **Military personnel abroad** | ~100,000 (mostly Philippines) | ~173,000 in 159 countries |
| **Economic integration** | Limited foreign investment | Dominant position in global finance, trade, institutions |
| **Cultural influence** | Regional | Global (Hollywood, social media, English language) |
| **Method of control** | Direct colonial administration | Economic hegemony, military bases, client regimes, corporate dominance |

**Assessment:** 2024 American empire is vastly more extensive but less visible than 1900.

### 8.2 Democratic Accountability and Public Debate

| Dimension | 1900 | 2024 |
|-----------|------|------|
| **Anti-imperial movement** | Robust (Anti-Imperialist League) | Marginal (CodePink, DSA, etc.) |
| **Mainstream debate** | Extensive (major issue in elections) | Minimal (bipartisan foreign policy consensus) |
| **Media coverage** | Diverse perspectives | Narrow parameters, corporate concentration |
| **Congressional role** | Treaty debate, appropriations scrutiny | AUMF rubber stamp, minimal oversight |
| **Public opinion impact** | Significant (Philippine war debates) | Minimal (Iraq War launched despite majority opposition) |

**Assessment:** Democratic accountability over imperial policy has dramatically declined despite formal democracy expanding.

### 8.3 Free Speech Rights and Practices

| Dimension | 1900 | 2024 |
|-----------|------|------|
| **Formal First Amendment rights** | Not incorporated against states; limited | Broad protection (especially corporate) |
| **Corporate speech rights** | Not recognized | Unlimited spending (*Citizens United*) |
| **Dissent suppression** | Episodic (Espionage Act, Red Scare) | Systematic (surveillance, criminalization) |
| **Media landscape** | Diverse newspapers, local ownership | Six-corporation dominance, algorithmic control |
| **Effective access to public discourse** | Relatively accessible | Increasingly paywalled (literal and figurative) |

**Assessment:** Formal free speech rights have expanded while practical ability to dissent has contracted—particularly for those challenging concentrated power.

### 8.4 Political Economy and Wealth Distribution

| Dimension | 1900 | 2024 |
|-----------|------|------|
| **Wealth concentration** | Gilded Age inequality | Exceeds Gilded Age (top 1% holds 32% of wealth) |
| **Corporate power** | Robber barons, trusts | Trillion-dollar tech monopolies, financial giants |
| **Campaign finance** | Limited, party-controlled | Unlimited (*Citizens United*), Super PACs, dark money |
| **Regulatory capacity** | Minimal (pre-Progressive Era) | Weakened (deregulation, defunding, corporate capture) |
| **Labor power** | Growing (union organizing increasing) | Weakened (private sector union density 6%) |

**Assessment:** Wealth concentration and corporate power are comparable or greater than the Gilded Age, but regulatory/labor capacity to counter them is weaker.

#### The Political Origins of Inequality: Winner-Take-All Politics

Yale political scientist Jacob S. Hacker and Berkeley political scientist Paul Pierson's *Winner-Take-All Politics* (2010) demolishes the myth that contemporary inequality results from impersonal economic forces like globalization or technological change. Through systematic analysis of policy decisions from the 1970s onward, they demonstrate that inequality is politically constructed:

> "The sources of American economic inequality are largely political—the result of deliberate political decisions to shape markets in ways that benefit the already-privileged at the expense of everyone else" (Hacker & Pierson, 2010, p. 298).

Key findings include:

1. **Organized business dominance:** "The organizational landscape of the US is dramatically skewed, with many influential organizations pushing the interests of business and the rich, while politicians pay attention to them because of their resources, and far fewer organizations represent the other side, especially given union decline."

2. **Corporate governance as inequality driver:** "The structure of American corporate governance and its associated patterns of executive compensation is a prime contributor to American winner-take-all inequality." Those at the top developed political muscle to cut their taxes, deregulate finance, weaken corporate governance, and hamstring labor unions.

3. **Systematic elimination of countervailing power:** Organizations successfully worked to eliminate oversight of corporate managers through multiple channels—private litigation, shareholder empowerment, SEC regulation, and labor organizing were all systematically weakened.

The result is a feedback loop: corporate power shapes policy, policy concentrates wealth, concentrated wealth purchases more political power.

#### Economic Policy Institute: Documenting "Failure by Design"

The Economic Policy Institute's research, synthesized in Josh Bivens' *Failure by Design* (2011), provides empirical documentation of how policy choices created contemporary inequality. Key findings include:

**Wage stagnation despite productivity growth:** From 1979 to 2024, worker productivity increased 80.9% while average hourly compensation increased just 29.4% (after adjusting for inflation). The American workforce became 84% more productive, but workers' wages grew far more slowly. This 50+ percentage point gap represents trillions in wealth transferred from labor to capital.

**CEO pay explosion:** CEO-to-worker pay ratios grew over 1,084% (ranging from 1,085% to 1,094% depending on year measured) compared to typical workers' pay growth of just 26% over six decades. In 1965, CEOs earned approximately 20 times average worker pay; by 2024, this ratio reached 281-to-1 at major corporations (EPI, 2024).

**Deliberate policy failures:** Bivens identifies the "cracked foundation" of American prosperity:
- Falling minimum wage (declining 30%+ in real terms since 1968)
- Assault on workers' right to organize (private sector union density collapsed from 35% to 6%)
- Global integration for American workers while elites remain insulated
- The rise of finance and regulatory capture
- Abandoning full employment as a policy target

As Bivens demonstrates, "economic growth since the late 1970s has been slow and inequitably distributed, largely as a result of poor policy choices" (Bivens, 2011, p. 2). These weren't inevitable market outcomes but deliberate political decisions that systematically redistributed wealth upward.

#### The Racial Wealth Gap

Economic Policy Institute research also documents how white supremacy and economic inequality reinforce each other. The wage gap between typical Black and white workers increased from 16.6% in 1979 to 21.6% in 2024, even as formal legal discrimination ended. This widening gap correlates directly with attacks on labor power and the productivity-pay divergence—suggesting that weakening worker power disproportionately harms Black workers while wealth concentration disproportionately benefits white elites (EPI, 2024).

### 8.5 Institutional Legitimacy

| Dimension | 1900 | 2024 |
|-----------|------|------|
| **Trust in government** | Relatively high | Historic lows (20-25%) |
| **Electoral integrity** | Contested (corruption, machines) | Contested (voter suppression, gerrymandering, 2020 Big Lie) |
| **Judicial legitimacy** | Moderate | Declining (partisan 6-3 Supreme Court) |
| **Media trust** | Partisan but local | Collapsed (partisan polarization, "fake news") |
| **Belief in democratic responsiveness** | Moderate | Low (Gilens & Page findings) |

**Assessment:** Institutional legitimacy has declined across the board, creating potential for democratic breakdown.

### 8.6 Synthesis: The Transformation Thesis

Comparing 1900 and 2024 reveals a fundamental transformation:

**1900:** A nation debating whether to become an imperial power, with robust democratic discourse constraining (though not preventing) territorial expansion. Wealth concentration was extreme but faced growing opposition (Progressive Era reforms, labor organizing). Democratic institutions were imperfect (no women's suffrage, Jim Crow, etc.) but expanding through social movements.

**2024:** A global empire operating with minimal democratic accountability. Wealth concentration exceeds the Gilded Age and is legally protected through *Citizens United* and judicial decisions. Democratic institutions are degraded through voter suppression, gerrymandering, and procedural obstruction. Corporate power dominates both foreign and domestic policy. Dissent is marginalized through media concentration, algorithmic control, and surveillance.

The transformation is not simply that America became more imperial (though it did), but that the domestic democratic capacity to constrain empire has been systematically dismantled. The same forces that drive imperialism abroad—concentrated corporate power seeking markets, resources, and profit—dominate domestic politics through unlimited political spending legalized by *Citizens United*.

The Anti-Imperialist League's arguments against empire (constitutional, moral, economic, strategic) have been proven correct in many respects: empire has indeed militarized society, eroded liberty, drained resources, and contradicted founding principles. Yet these arguments have been excluded from mainstream political discourse, not through censorship, but through the systematic construction of an information ecosystem where only elite-friendly perspectives receive amplification.

## 9. Conclusion

This paper has traced the transformation of American power from the contested territorial expansion of 1898-1920 to the unchallenged global hegemony of 2024. The Anti-Imperialist League's vigorous opposition to the Philippine-American War represented a democratic polity grappling with foundational questions about empire and self-determination. That such a debate occurred—and that anti-imperialists could effectively mobilize public opinion, influence elections, and constrain (if not prevent) imperial policy—demonstrates a level of democratic vitality unimaginable today.

The contemporary American empire operates through economic hegemony, military basing, dollar dominance, and corporate integration rather than direct territorial control. This makes it simultaneously more extensive and less visible than classical imperialism. More importantly, it operates with minimal democratic accountability. The post-9/11 forever wars, regime change operations, drone campaigns, and surveillance programs proceed with bipartisan elite consensus and marginal public scrutiny.

This transformation cannot be separated from domestic political economy. The *Citizens United* decision represents the legal culmination of a decades-long project to equate money with speech and corporations with persons. Mitch McConnell has been the principal political architect of this project, systematically dismantling campaign finance regulations, blocking reform efforts, and engineering judicial appointments to lock in unlimited corporate political spending as constitutionally protected.

The result is what empirical political science identifies as oligarchy: a system where policy reflects elite preferences regardless of majority opinion (Gilens & Page, 2014). This is not oligarchy through corruption or autocracy, but through formally legal mechanisms—unlimited political spending translates concentrated wealth into political power, which produces policies that further concentrate wealth, creating a self-reinforcing feedback loop.

Journalist Chris Hedges, drawing on decades of reporting on imperial decline, describes this transformation with characteristic directness: ruling elites "have destroyed our capitalist democracy and replaced it with a mafia state" where both corporate and oligarchic power "have each bought up the political class, the academy and the press," functioning as "forms of exploitation that impoverish and disempower the public" while funneling "money upwards into the hands of the billionaire class" (Hedges, 2024). What Cicero called a commonwealth—a res publica, the public thing—has become "an instrument of naked pillage and repression on behalf of a global corporate oligarchy."

Hedges identifies the roots of American fascism not in Trumpism per se, but in "the systemic rot of liberal institutions, corporate and oligarchic domination, and the moral and spiritual vacuum left in their wake" (Hedges, 2025). The choice offered to voters is not between democracy and oligarchy, but between different forms of oligarchic power: corporate power that requires stability and technocratic management versus chaotic oligarchic power that seeks to "deconstruct the administrative state." Neither is democratic; both serve concentrated wealth.

This "political paralysis" allows "ruling oligarchs, who have increased their wealth by nearly a third since the pandemic began," to orchestrate "virtual tax boycotts" and extract unprecedented wealth while infrastructure crumbles, social services collapse, and democratic institutions decay (Hedges, 2023). The system is not broken—it is working exactly as designed to transfer wealth upward and insulate power from accountability.

Paradoxically, this oligarchy operates under an expansive interpretation of "free speech." *Citizens United* holds that restricting corporate political spending violates the First Amendment. Yet this "freedom" exists alongside the systematic suppression of grassroots organizing through surveillance, criminalization of protest, SLAPP suits, and media concentration. The Anti-Imperialist League's ability to challenge empire through publications, speeches, and organizing has no contemporary equivalent—not because such activity is formally prohibited, but because the information ecosystem has been structured to marginalize dissent that threatens concentrated power.

The comparative analysis reveals that formal democratic rights have expanded (First Amendment incorporated against states, broadened over time) while practical democratic capacity has contracted. In 1900, despite limited formal rights, democratic movements could effectively challenge concentrated power. In 2024, despite expansive formal rights, such movements face structural obstacles that render them largely ineffective: media concentration, algorithmic filtering, surveillance, voter suppression, gerrymandering, and counter-majoritarian institutions all combine to insulate elite power from democratic accountability.

This transformation matters not merely as historical curiosity but as urgent political crisis. The degradation of democracy and expansion of empire are mutually reinforcing: imperial policy serves corporate interests that dominate domestic politics, while domestic oligarchy prevents democratic constraint of imperial power. The climate crisis, nuclear weapons proliferation, pandemic risk, and other existential threats require global cooperation and rapid mobilization—precisely what the current system of corporate-dominated politics and imperial competition prevents.

### 9.1 Theoretical Implications

This analysis suggests several theoretical conclusions:

**First**, classical theories of imperialism (Lenin, Luxemburg, etc.) that emphasized economic drivers remain relevant but require updating. Contemporary imperialism operates less through direct colonial extraction than through financialization, debt, intellectual property monopolies, and institutional control (IMF, World Bank). The form has changed but the function—transferring wealth from periphery to core—continues.

**Second**, liberal democratic theory's assumption that democratic institutions constrain concentrated power has been falsified. The United States possesses all the formal institutions of democracy (elections, free speech, rule of law) yet functions as an oligarchy. This suggests that formal institutions are insufficient without broader social and economic conditions that enable democratic participation.

**Third**, the concept of "free speech" requires critical examination. When speech is equated with spending, and spending is radically unequal, "free speech" becomes a mechanism of domination rather than liberation. A democratic theory of free speech must attend to conditions of effective communication, not merely absence of formal censorship.

**Fourth**, the relationship between domestic and foreign policy is tighter than often recognized. The same corporate interests that dominate domestic politics through unlimited spending drive foreign policy toward protecting markets, securing resources, and maintaining hegemony. Challenging imperialism abroad requires challenging oligarchy at home, and vice versa.

### 9.2 Normative Implications

If this analysis is correct, several normative conclusions follow:

**First**, constitutional amendment to overturn *Citizens United* is necessary but insufficient. Even pre-*Citizens United*, wealth heavily influenced politics. Genuine democracy requires not merely regulation of political spending but substantial equalization of economic power—progressive taxation, strengthened labor rights, antitrust enforcement, public financing of campaigns, etc.

**Second**, media reform is essential to democracy. Concentrated corporate ownership, algorithmic filtering, and surveillance capitalism must be challenged through antitrust enforcement, public and cooperative ownership models, platform regulation, and support for independent journalism.

**Third**, democratic foreign policy requires dismantling the national security state's immunity from accountability. Congressional war powers must be reclaimed, covert operations must face scrutiny, military budgets must be debated, and the human costs of empire must be made visible.

**Fourth**, the climate crisis makes imperial competition unsustainable. Global cooperation on climate, pandemic prevention, nuclear weapons elimination, etc. requires transcending imperial domination and building genuinely multilateral institutions.

### 9.3 Strategic Implications for Movements

For social movements seeking to challenge oligarchy and empire, several strategic implications emerge:

**First**, the degradation of democratic institutions means that working within conventional politics is necessary but insufficient. Electoral organizing must be combined with movement-building that creates power outside formal institutions.

**Second**, the Anti-Imperialist League's failure to prevent empire but success in shaping public discourse offers lessons. Even unsuccessful movements can shift political culture, create new generations of organizers, and lay groundwork for future mobilizations.

**Third**, the integration of domestic oligarchy and foreign empire means that movements must connect these issues. Anti-war organizing must connect to economic justice; labor organizing must connect to anti-imperialism; climate justice must connect to both.

**Fourth**, the information ecosystem's structural biases mean that movements cannot rely on mainstream media for fair coverage. Independent media, direct organizing, and alternative communication channels are essential.

**Fifth**, the surveillance state's targeting of dissidents requires security culture, legal support infrastructure, and political defense campaigns. The state will use every tool to disrupt threatening movements; preparation is essential.

### 9.4 The Path Forward

The situation described in this paper—oligarchy at home, empire abroad, degraded democratic institutions, climate crisis accelerating—is dire. Yet history suggests that systems that appear permanent can collapse rapidly when contradictions sharpen and movements mobilize.

The Anti-Imperialist League ultimately failed to prevent American empire, but their arguments proved prophetic. Empire did erode constitutional governance, militarize society, drain resources, and contradict founding principles. The question is whether a contemporary movement can succeed where they failed.

Such a movement would need to:

1. **Build class consciousness** about oligarchy and its mechanisms
2. **Connect domestic and foreign policy** (oligarchy enables empire; empire serves oligarchy)
3. **Create alternative institutions** that prefigure democratic governance
4. **Challenge corporate power** through labor organizing, antitrust, public ownership
5. **Demand democratic foreign policy** through anti-war organizing, base closures, military budget cuts
6. **Reform democratic institutions** through voting rights, campaign finance, proportional representation
7. **Build international solidarity** with movements globally challenging imperialism and oligarchy

The odds of success are uncertain. The forces arrayed against democratic transformation—trillion-dollar corporations, militarized state apparatus, compliant media, captured courts—are formidable. But the alternative—continuation of the current trajectory toward climate catastrophe, nuclear war, and authoritarian collapse—is unacceptable.

The Anti-Imperialist League's legacy is not their success in preventing empire but their demonstration that principled opposition is possible. They show that ordinary citizens can challenge even powerful institutions by organizing, speaking truth, and refusing complicity. Their arguments—that empire contradicts self-determination, that military conquest erodes liberty, that constitutional principles matter—remain as relevant in 2024 as in 1898.

The task for contemporary movements is to revive that tradition of principled anti-imperialism while connecting it to challenges the Anti-Imperialist League could not have anticipated: climate crisis, nuclear weapons, surveillance capitalism, algorithmic control. The question is not whether the current system is sustainable—it demonstrably is not. The question is whether democratic movements can build sufficient power to transform it before crisis forces transformation in catastrophic ways.

History is not predetermined. The trajectory from the Anti-Imperialist League's vigorous democracy to *Citizens United*'s oligarchy was not inevitable; it resulted from specific political choices, judicial decisions, and movement defeats. Different choices, decisions, and movement victories could produce different outcomes.

The hour is late, but not yet too late. The work of democracy, as always, belongs to those willing to do it.
